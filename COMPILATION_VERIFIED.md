# BACnet4Linux Compilation Verified

## Issue Resolved
The "No rule to make target 'all'" error was caused by improper tab formatting in the Makefile.

## Fix Applied
- Corrected Makefile with proper TAB characters (not spaces)
- Verified local compilation succeeds
- All required source files present
- Binary builds successfully

## Test Results
```bash
cd bacnet-gpio-controller/pi_deployment/bacnet4linux/
make clean && make
# Compilation succeeds with warnings but builds executable
```

## Repository Status
✓ Fixed Makefile uploaded to GitHub
✓ All 74 BACnet4Linux source files present
✓ Compilation tested and verified working
✓ Ready for Raspberry Pi deployment

The repository now successfully compiles the BACnet GPIO controller.
